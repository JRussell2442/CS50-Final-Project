Welcome to our project, Harvard's very own Q Guide for clubs.
 
Designed by students, for students, the Club Q seeks to demystify the at times confusing and difficult to navigate extracurricular scene at Harvard College. With over 500 student-run organizations, getting involved can be daunting even for the most seasoned of students. With nowhere to find information on the experiences of those who have been previously involved, it's difficult for potential members to know about the club workload, community, social climate and culture.
 
So, we’ve created a place for just that! The Club Q allows students to register, login, rate and view all 533 of Harvard’s student-run clubs, as registered with the Student Organisation Center at Hilles.
 
PROJECT RUN-DOWN
The Club Q is fully responsive, so we recommend that you check out the adaptive nature of the pages and each element within them.
 
Upon opening the project, you will be prompted to login. As you won’t already have an account, it’s a good idea to register by clicking on the ‘register’ button at the bottom of the login form. This will cause the central box to expand, as the registration form page will be rendered in place of the login page. 
 
REGISTER
Once on the register page, you can create an account but beware - only an email address with the ‘@harvard.college.edu’ domain will be valid. This was designed so that only students at Harvard College can register for an account. If/when this website does eventually go live, we’ll ensure that only an actual @college.harvard.edu address can be registered, via email confirmation or the like. 
 
If you happen to enter an email address that is invalid, you’ll be prompted to try again. You will also find that if a username is already taken (you can test this by trying to sign up with the username ‘1’, which we’ve already registered as an account), you’ll receive an error message and will have to choose a different one. Similarly to the invalid email address or taken username, if your chosen password does not match the confirmation, you’ll have to fix the issue. 
 
Once registered, you’ll be redirected to the login page.
 
LOGIN
The login page has username and password fields. These are rather intuitive - if you input into either of the fields incorrectly, you’ll be sent an error message and will have to try again.
 
If you enter the information correctly and press the ‘login’ button, the homepage will be rendered, and the navbar will alter to show the ‘Home’, ‘Clubs’ and ‘Log Out’ options.
 
NAVBAR
The navbar changes depending upon which page you are on. When on the login page, you’ll see drop-down options to ‘login’ and/or ‘register’. You’ll only be able to access the list of clubs, form review page and the club-q itself once logged in. This is intentional by design: it ensures that the privacy of student club data is upheld, whilst enabling general web users to access the website and register and/or login (if they are a Harvard College student).
 
HOME
Congratulations! You’re looking at the homepage of Harvard’s first q-guide for clubs.
Feel free to click the button to learn more about how to rank and view clubs, or alternatively, just navigate straight to the ‘Clubs’ tab. Here are the general instructions for how to use the guide:
 
CLUBS
Once on the clubs page, you’ll see a list of clubs, each with corresponding ‘Review’ and ‘TheQ’ buttons. Start by clicking on ‘Review’ to submit the form
 
// REVIEW
Once the review button is clicked, you’ll be taken to a review form for that particular club. Fill out the fields as prompted. 
 
For the rankings, ‘1’ is the lowest, whilst ‘5’ is the highest. Once you’ve clicked ‘Submit’, you’ll be redirected to the clubs page. You can now click on ‘TheQ’ to view the guide for any of the clubs. It’s probably a good idea to click on ‘TheQ’ for the club that you reviewed, so you can see your review as part of the guide.
 
// THEQ
The Q is the guide, and it shows the average ratings for social, workload and comp across all reviews. It also has a comments box in which you can see all comments submitted by users when reviewing the clubs. This is a scroll box and - like all aspects of our website - is fully responsive to a change in screen size. Once you’re done with the Q, you can navigate back to any of the pages, or optionally, log out.
 
LOG OUT
The log out button simply logs the user out, rendering the login page.
